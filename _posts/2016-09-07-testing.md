The [pippo-test]({{ site.codeurl }}/pippo-test) module provides JUnit4 [PippoTest]({{ site.codeurl }}/pippo-test/src/main/java/ro/pippo/test/PippoTest.java) class for starting your application in TEST mode on a randomly available HTTP port.   
`PippoTest` comes with a simple and intuitive API, based on [Rest-Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured).

`Rest-Assured` is automatically configured for this instance of your application allowing you to easily make HTTP requests to your test instance and focus on unit and integration testing of your code.

#### How to use

```java
public class RouteTest extends PippoTest {

    @Rule
    public PippoRule pippoRule = new PippoRule(new PippoApplication());

    @Test
    public void testIndex() {
        when().
            get("/").
        then().
            statusCode(200);
    }

    @Test
    public void testHello() {
        Response response = get("/hello");
        response.then().statusCode(200);
        response.then().contentType(ContentType.HTML);
        assertEquals("Hello World", response.asString());
    }

}
```

Also don't forget to add `pippo-test` as dependency in your project:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>ro.pippo</groupId>
    <artifactId>pippo-test</artifactId>
    <version>${pippo.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Implementation details

The central piece in `pippo-test` module is [PippoRule]({{ site.codeurl }}/pippo-test/src/main/java/ro/pippo/test/PippoRule.java).   
`PippoRule` is a __JUnit Rule__ that start Pippo prior to test execution and stop Pippo after the tests have completed.   
`PippoTest` class is optionally and it not contains logic. You can create your Test class without toextend PippoTest. `PippoTest` class only extends `RestAssured`.   
`RestAssured` it's a Java DSL library for easy testing REST services.

You can change how many instances of Pippo are created via `@Rule` and `@ClassRule` annotations(JUnit annotations).   
If you want one Pippo instance for __EACH__ test then you must add below code in your test class:

```java
@Rule
public PippoRule pippoRule = new PippoRule(new PippoApplication());
```

If you want one Pippo instance for __ALL__ tests then instead of the above code line you must add:

```java
@ClassRule
public static PippoRule pippoRule = new PippoRule(new PippoApplication());
```
